# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
According to the AWS GuardDuty documentation, the service continuously monitors and analyzes various data sources to identify potential security threats 
and unauthorized activities within your AWS environment. 
Some of the key data sources that GuardDuty uses include:
    1. VPC Flow Logs: 
        - GuardDuty analyzes the network traffic flow logs within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to detect anomalous or suspicious network activity, 
        such as connections to known malicious IP addresses.
    2. AWS CloudTrail Logs: 
        - GuardDuty processes the AWS CloudTrail management event logs to identify unusual API calls 
        or account access patterns that could indicate an attempted compromise.
    3. DNS Logs: 
        - GuardDuty monitors the Domain Name System (DNS) logs to detect attempts to connect to malicious domains or IP addresses, 
        which could be a sign of malware or other malicious activity.
    4. AWS CloudTrail S3 Data Event Logs: 
        - GuardDuty analyzes the S3 data event logs to detect unusual or unauthorized access to your S3 buckets, 
        which could be a sign of data exfiltration or other malicious activities.
