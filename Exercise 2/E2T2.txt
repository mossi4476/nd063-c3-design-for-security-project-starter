Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
=> Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. S3 general purpose buckets should require requests to use SSL: 
    - This vulnerability is related to the security of data in transit to and from the S3 buckets.
* Recommendation: 
    - Update the S3 bucket policy to deny any requests that do not use HTTPS (Secure Socket Layer). 
    - This can be done by adding a condition to the bucket policy that checks the "aws:SecureTransport" condition key 
    and denies any requests that are not using SSL/TLS.

2. S3 general purpose buckets should have Lifecycle configurations:
    - This vulnerability is related to the management and retention of data stored in the S3 buckets.
* Recommendation: 
    - Configure Lifecycle rules for the S3 buckets to automatically transition older objects 
    to a lower-cost storage class (e.g., Glacier)  or delete objects after a certain period of time, based on your data retention policies.

3. Attached EBS volumes should be encrypted at-rest:
    - This vulnerability is related to the security of data stored on the EBS volumes.
*Recommendation: 
    - Enable encryption at-rest for all EBS volumes attached to your EC2 instances. 
    - This can be done by creating the volumes with encryption enabled or by modifying the encryption settings of existing volumes.

4. VPC default security groups should not allow inbound or outbound traffic:
    - This vulnerability is related to the security of your VPC network.
*Recommendation: 
    - Review and update the default security group rules to deny all inbound and outbound traffic. 
    - Instead, create custom security groups with the least-privilege access required for your resources.

5. Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 22
    - This vulnerability is related to the security of your EC2 instances, specifically SSH access.
Recommendation: 
    - Update the security group rules to restrict SSH access (port 22) to only the necessary IP addresses or ranges, 
    instead of allowing access from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0).

6. EC2 subnets should not automatically assign public IP addresses:
    - This vulnerability is related to the network configuration of your EC2 instances.
* Recommendation: 
    - Review the subnet settings and ensure that the "Auto-assign public IP" option is disabled. 
    - This will prevent EC2 instances from being assigned a public IP address by default, 
    which can help improve the security of your network.
