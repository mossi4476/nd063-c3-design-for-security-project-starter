# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following
### Example vulnerability

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
    - AWS CloudFormation Guard: Allowing unrestricted SSH access (0.0.0.0/0) to EC2 instances in the CloudFormation template.
    - Checkov:  Unencrypted S3 buckets or EBS volumes defined in the Infrastructure as Code templates.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
    - Amazon Inspector: Outdated operating system packages with known security vulnerabilities in the AMI or container image.
    - Clair: Presence of high-severity CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the container image dependencies.
    
##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
    - AWS Config: Security groups allowing unrestricted inbound access (0.0.0.0/0) to sensitive ports like SSH (22) or RDP (3389).
